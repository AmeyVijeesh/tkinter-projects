# Tkinter projects

This repository includes some Tkinter projects made by me. All of these are simple to understand. I create apps with good functionality as well as good interfaces. 


# Modules needed
The main module used here is Tkinter, but some of the projects use additional modules. You can always install them from www.pypi.org.

Python 3.8 is used here, in most of the projects. 

```pip install python-tk```
Tkinter is build-in, but in case you don't have it, install it using this command.
